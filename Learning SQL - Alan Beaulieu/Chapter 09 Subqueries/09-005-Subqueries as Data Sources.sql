-- Since a subquery generates a result set containing rows
-- and columns of data, it is perfectly valid to include subqueries 
-- in your from clause along with tables.

-- Subqueries used in the from clause must be noncorrelated;1 they are executed first,
-- and the data is held in memory until the containing query finishes execution.

-- the total number of film rentals and total payments for each customer, while the second
-- subquery, named pymnt_grps, generates the three customer groupings. The two
-- subqueries are joined by finding which of the three groups each customer belongs to,
-- and the rows are then grouped by the group name in order to count the number of
-- customers in each group.
