 # Cross Joins
-- To generate the Cartesian product of two tables, you should specify a cross join.

-- One applpication is to generate a table with 366 rows (2020 is a leap year) with a single 
-- column containing a number between 0 and 366 and then add that number of days to 
-- January 1, 2020? Hereâ€™s one possible method to generate such a table.
