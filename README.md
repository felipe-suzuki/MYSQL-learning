# MYSQL-learning
I will be uploading some SQL files with queries that I am using to practice what I am currently learning.

I uploaded the code to create the schema employees used on the exercises.

You can download the file directly and open 
on MYSQLWorkbench (feel free to pick another program of your choice).

All the exercises have the description commented on the file. I hope you enjoy it!
